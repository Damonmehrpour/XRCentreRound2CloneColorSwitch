# XRCentreRound2CloneColorSwitch
## Project Overview

This project is a Unity-based game where the player controls a colored ball that interacts with obstacles and color switches. The game includes scoring, color-changing mechanics, and a game-over scenario when the ball falls out of bounds.

## Features

- **Ball Control:** The player can control the ball's movement and jumping.
- **Color Switching:** The ball can change color and must match the color of obstacles.
- **Scoring:** Points are earned by collecting stars.
- **Game Over:** The game restarts when the ball falls out of bounds or hits an obstacle with the wrong color.

## Functionality and Requirements

- Implemented color switching for the ball with four distinct colors.
- The game restarts immediately when the ball falls out of the camera bounds or hits an obstacle with the wrong color.
- Added particle effects for game-over scenarios and scoring events.

## Code Style and Comments

- Followed consistent naming conventions and modular design principles.
- Added comments to key sections of the code to improve readability and maintainability.

## Known Issues

- The build did not work in my computer( a bit weak computer) rebuilt after cloning and it will work!

## Instructions

- **Local Setup:** Clone the repository and address it through Unity engine 2022.3.21f.
- **Web Deployment:** [Include the URL of the WebGL build and instructions on how to access it.]

## Future Features

**1. Artistic Background**
- **Description:** Adding a dynamic and artistic background to enhance player immersion and give a sense of progression.
- **Implementation:** Design multiple background layers with parallax scrolling to create depth and visual interest.

**2. Endless Gameplay**
- **Description:** Implementing an endless gameplay mode with auto-generated levels for continuous play.
- **Implementation:** Create a level generation system that dynamically spawns obstacles, stars, and color switchers. The difficulty will increase as the player progresses.

**3. Menu System**
- **Description:** Adding a menu system for starting the game, viewing scores, and accessing settings.
- **Implementation:** Use Unity's UI system to design a main menu and game-over screen with interactive buttons.

**4. Power-Ups**
- **Description:** Introducing power-ups to modify game mechanics, such as slowing down rotations or enhancing jump behavior.
- **Implementation:** Develop power-ups like slow-motion effects and enhanced jumps as collectible items in the game.
